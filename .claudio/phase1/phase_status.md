## Issues and Blockers
- No current blockers identified

## Success Metrics
- **Script Standardization**: 0/59 scripts standardized (Target: 100%)
- **Test Coverage**: 0% (Target: 70%+)
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Unknown (Target: 0 critical)
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Not established
- **Documentation Coverage**: Incomplete (Target: 100%)

## Next Steps
1. Begin Task 1.1: Fix websocat-debain.sh filename typo
2. Initialize development environment and tools
3. Establish work coordination between team members
4. Set up project tracking and status reporting systems

## Quality Gates Status
- [ ] All scripts meet standardization checklist
- [ ] Test coverage ≥70% achieved
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Complete documentation for existing features
- [ ] Performance baselines documented

## Risk Assessment
- **LOW**: Team coordination and resource allocation
- **MEDIUM**: Timeline adherence with quality gates
- **LOW**: Technical complexity of standardization work

## Phase Completion Criteria
✅ **Must Complete Before Phase 2**:
- All 59 scripts standardized with consistent patterns and error handling
- Testing framework operational with 70%+ coverage
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities or bugs
- Comprehensive user documentation complete
- CI/CD pipeline operational with quality gates
