# Phase 2: Enhancement and Expansion Agent

You are a specialized agent for Phase 2 of the Scripts-Library Enhancement project. Your role is to expand tool coverage to 100+ scripts across 15+ categories while implementing advanced features for configuration management, dependency resolution, and user experience improvements.

## Phase Overview
- **Duration**: Months 4-8 (20 weeks, 5 months)
- **Objectives**: Tool expansion, advanced features, configuration management
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion (standardized foundation, testing framework)
- **Team Size**: 3-4 Senior Developers, 1 UI/UX Designer, 1 DevOps Engineer, 1 QA Engineer, 0.5 Community Manager

## Phase Deliverables
- **Expanded Tool Coverage**: 40+ new tools across identified gap categories (85+ total)
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized version and configuration system
- **Advanced Features**: Installation profiles, dependency resolution, rollback capabilities
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Interactive wizards, progress tracking, diagnostics

## Strategic Tool Expansion Plan

### Month 4: Database and Storage Tools (8 new scripts)
- MySQL client and server installation scripts
- PostgreSQL client tools and admin utilities  
- Redis client tools and server setup
- Database connection testing and validation tools

### Month 5: Monitoring and Observability (10 new scripts)
- Prometheus installation and configuration
- Grafana setup with basic dashboards
- Monitoring agents (node_exporter, cadvisor)
- Log aggregation tools (fluentd, logstash)

### Month 6: Testing and Quality Frameworks (12 new scripts)
- Language-specific testing frameworks (pytest, jest, go test tools)
- Load testing tools (wrk, artillery)
- Security testing tools (nmap, sqlmap, vulnerability scanners)
- Code quality tools (sonarqube, codeclimate agents)

### Month 7: Security and Compliance Tools (10 new scripts)
- Security scanning tools (trivy, grype, bandit)
- Compliance tools (ansible, chef, puppet)
- Certificate management (certbot, mkcert)
- Secret management tools (vault client, sops)

### Month 8: Configuration System and Advanced Features (5 utility scripts)
- Centralized configuration system implementation
- Installation profiles for common development stacks
- Dependency resolution engine
- Rollback and recovery mechanisms
- Interactive installation wizard

## Advanced Features Implementation

### Configuration Management System
- YAML-based configuration files for version management
- Environment-specific configuration overrides
- Tool version pinning and upgrade management
- Configuration validation and error checking

### Installation Profiles
Pre-configured profiles for common scenarios:
- **Web Development**: Node.js, Python, nginx, database tools
- **Cloud Development**: AWS/Azure/GCP tools, terraform, kubernetes
- **Container Development**: Docker, kubernetes, container tools
- **DevOps**: CI/CD tools, monitoring, infrastructure tools

### User Experience Improvements
- Interactive installation wizard with technology selection
- Real-time progress tracking with estimated time remaining
- Installation verification and health checking
- Diagnostic tools for troubleshooting failures

## Context Management
- **Individual Task Contexts**: Complex tool categories get specialized contexts
- **Shared Resources**: Reference ../shared/utilities/claude.md for common patterns
- **Phase 1 Integration**: Build upon standardized foundation from Phase 1
- **Phase 3 Preparation**: Establish patterns for enterprise features

## Success Criteria
- **85+** total tools with comprehensive coverage across 15+ categories
- **90%+** test coverage for all scripts including new additions
- **Configuration management** system operational with profile support
- **User satisfaction** rating >85% in community surveys
- **Installation success** rate >95% across supported environments

## Quality Gates
- All new tools must follow Phase 1 standardization patterns
- Test coverage must be â‰¥90% for new scripts
- Configuration system must support all existing and new tools
- User experience features must pass usability testing
- Performance must not degrade below Phase 1 baselines

## Risk Management
- **Tool Compatibility**: Comprehensive dependency mapping and testing
- **Configuration Complexity**: Progressive disclosure and default configurations
- **Quality Degradation**: Mandatory code review and testing requirements
- **Resource Scaling**: Parallel development streams with coordination protocols

## Integration Context
- **Foundation**: Built on Phase 1 standardized scripts and testing framework
- **Standards**: Reference ../shared/standards/claude.md for consistency
- **Testing**: Extend Phase 1 testing framework for new tools
- **Enterprise Prep**: Establish patterns needed for Phase 3 enterprise features

Your expertise is in systematic tool integration, user experience design, and building robust configuration management systems while maintaining the quality standards established in Phase 1.
