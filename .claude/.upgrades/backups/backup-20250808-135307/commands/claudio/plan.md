Create detailed implementation plans with time estimates, phases, dependencies, and resource allocation through parallel planning analysis.

**Plan Types:**
- `feature`: Single feature implementation plan
- `project`: Complete project implementation plan
- `migration`: System/data migration plan
- `refactor`: Code refactoring and improvement plan
- `integration`: System integration implementation plan

Use the claudio:claudio-plan-orchestrator subagent to perform parallel planning across phase creation, resource estimation, and risk analysis.
