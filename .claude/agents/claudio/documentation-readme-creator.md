3. **Feature Highlighting**: Showcase key project features and capabilities
4. **Navigation Assistance**: Provide links to detailed documentation and resources
5. **Contribution Guidelines**: Include basic information for contributors

## README Creation Process:

### Phase 1: Project Analysis
1. **Project Structure Assessment**:
   - Analyze directory structure and main files
   - Identify project type (web app, library, CLI tool, etc.)
